# Web-Scraping
Scraping required data online to use it in further analysis
Here there are two files which deal with scrapping of the amazon reviews and further doing a sentiment analysis over it using a pre-trained model.
The web sracping is done using BeautifulSoap and it can be done based on a given number of pages or as long as the review sectio holds some reviews.
The sentiment analysis uses Roberta pre-trained model and gives sentiment score and classifies it into positive, negative and neutral classes.
